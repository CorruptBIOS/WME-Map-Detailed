# WME-Map-Detailed
Waze WME script built by talented people to reduce the time needed to touch up a segment.

**Meet the script developers**
- RoadAssister
# **What will it do:**
While selecting a road segment in WME that looks rough with sharp turn angles in a slight turn. Using a slider bar under the script tab you can gradually increase the smoothness of a road segment that isn't neat and more sudden into a segment that has smooth curves, giving it a more forgiving look.

# **Troubleshooting:**
If a problem occurs while using the script, it would use WME to display the error, for instance if the segment has less points than required. For more technical errors such as an issue within the code itself you would use the browser's console.

# **Debugging:**
A feature for those who like looking at every action the script performs, and for those who are checking the script for bugs or problems. Using the built-in browser's console, the script will then log each action taking place such as the following examples below:

 ``WME Map Detailer: Welcome to WME, {Current User}.``
 
 ``WME Map Detailer: {Segment #} currently selected.``
 
 ``WME Map Detailer: Segment unselected.``
 
 ``WME Map Detailer: The current segment has too many points.``
 
 ``WME Map Detailer: The current segment has less than 6 many points.``
 
 ``WME Map Detailer: {Error Title} {Cause of Error}``
